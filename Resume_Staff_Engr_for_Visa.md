### CURRENT ROLE

**Senior Staff Systems Engineer**

### JOB SUMMARY

- Modeling of  physical layer blocks in both transmit and receive, including fixed-points. Performance tuning of PHY models. Supporting RTL and DV on the design and verification of PHY blocks. Supporting E2E team towards verifying PHY firware(FW).
- Implementation and validation of baseband-radio calibrations including IQ correction (both transmit and receive), carrier leak correction, DC offset correction and noise floor calibration.
- Validation and tuning of PHY modules including transmit power control, receive gain table, heavy clip, spectral scan.
- Design of proprietary features like **Air Time Management** in a simulation environment and support for implementation of the same in software.
- Tuning and validation of features which involve MAC - PHY interactions like Adaptive Rate Control, Interference Management and Auto Channel Selection.
- Support to software and customer engineering teams towards fixing issues on performance, baseband calibrations, baseband errors, hangs etc.

### PROJECTS

#### Modeling Projects

These projects involve fixed point modeling and implementation of various PHY blocks. My primary contribution is on the following blocks:
- Receive frequency domain (RxFD) channel estimation and packet BW selection
- Receive standalone replay mechanism
- Modeling of the complete beamforming data path from beamformer to beamformee

#### Design Projects

These projects involve designing new features in a proprietary simulation environment written in C and C++. 
Following are the projects I worked on.
- Implementation of a bursting mechanism.
- Design of throughput based air-time fairness.
- Implementation of rate vs range simulation for various WLAN deployment scenarios, especially multi-client scenarios.

#### Chip bring-up

I have been part of several chip bring-ups both on 11n and 11ac, working on validation of various PHY and MAC modules which includes:
- Pre-Silicon bringup in FPGA and support to DV, HAL-PHY and SW
- Multi-User MIMO Protocol level validation.
- Transmit Beamforming. 
- Transmit Power Control and Transmit gain table design.
- Heavy clip filter design in MATLAB and validation in HW.
- Band edge tuning and Spur mitigation.
- Transmit and Receive calibrations. 
- Receive Gain table design and validation

#### Emusim (Emulation-Simulation)
I owned running unit tests in the emulation-simulation environment in Pre-Silicon phase to debug critical issues that can't be caught in emulation platforms.

#### Revamp of Interference handling engine
This involves hands-on characterization of the blocker capabilities of the existing solution and implementation of an interference handling engine to improve the chip's rejection capability both on adjacent and alternate channels. 

#### Support and bug fix
I am actively involved in bug fixing and support on issues related to
- Dynamic frequency selection.
- Auto and Dynamic channel selection.
- Transmit and Receive calibrations like Noise floor, Tx/Rx IQ, peak detect. 
- Customer support on certification failures like ETSI, FCC
- System hangs in interference scenarios.
- TCP and UDP performance hit.
